/*
 * SHARED COMPONENT VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 6 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Component ViewModels:
 * - StatsBoxVM.cs
 * - ActionButtonVM.cs
 * - StatsOverlayVM.cs
 * - ActionToolbarVM.cs
 * - SharedCommentVM.cs
 * - CommentsSectionVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Shared.ViewModels;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
