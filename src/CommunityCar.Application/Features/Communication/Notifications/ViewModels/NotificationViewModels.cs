/*
 * NOTIFICATION VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * ======================================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 2 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Notification ViewModels:
 * - NotificationVM.cs
 * - BulkNotificationVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Notifications.ViewModels;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
