/// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. Each ViewModel class
/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
/// 
/// Individual files:
/// - SecurityOverviewVM.cs - Security overview with two-factor, sessions, and activity
/// - SecurityLogItemVM.cs - Individual security log entry
/// - ChangeEmailVM.cs - Email change request with validation
/// - SecurityVM.cs - Combined security view model
/// - UpdateEmailVM.cs - Alias for ChangeEmailVM (compatibility)
/// - SecurityOverviewWebVM.cs - Alias for SecurityOverviewVM (compatibility)
/// - SecurityLogItemWebVM.cs - Alias for SecurityLogItemVM (compatibility)
/// - UserSessionVM.cs - Alias for ActiveSessionVM (compatibility)
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.
/// </summary>

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
