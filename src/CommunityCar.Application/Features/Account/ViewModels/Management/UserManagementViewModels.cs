/// User Management ViewModels
/// 
/// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. Each ViewModel class
/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
/// 
/// Individual files:
/// - ManagedUserVM.cs - Managed user with manager assignment details
/// - ManagementDashboardVM.cs - Management dashboard with hierarchy and statistics
/// - ManagementHierarchyVM.cs - Management hierarchy level with managed users
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.
/// </summary>

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
