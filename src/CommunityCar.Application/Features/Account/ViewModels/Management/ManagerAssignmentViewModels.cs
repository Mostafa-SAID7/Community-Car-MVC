/// Manager Assignment ViewModels

/// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. Each ViewModel class
/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
/// 
/// Individual files:
/// - AssignManagerVM.cs - Manager assignment with current and available managers
/// - ManagerOptionVM.cs - Available manager option with details and availability
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.
/// </summary>

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
