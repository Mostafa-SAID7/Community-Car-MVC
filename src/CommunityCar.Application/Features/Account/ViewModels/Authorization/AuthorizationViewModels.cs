/// Authorization ViewModels and Request Models
/// 
/// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. Each ViewModel and Request model
/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
/// 
/// Individual files:
/// - RoleVM.cs - Role view model with permissions and user count
/// - PermissionVM.cs - Permission view model with category and status
/// - RoleStatsVM.cs - Role statistics with user counts and permission breakdown
/// - UserRoleSummaryVM.cs - Summary of user role assignments
/// - UserPermissionSummaryVM.cs - Summary of user permission grants
/// - RolePermissionSummaryVM.cs - Summary of role permission grants
/// - PermissionAuditVM.cs - Audit trail for permission changes
/// - CreateRoleRequest.cs - Request model for creating new roles
/// - UpdateRoleRequest.cs - Request model for updating existing roles
/// - CreatePermissionRequest.cs - Request model for creating new permissions
/// - UpdatePermissionRequest.cs - Request model for updating existing permissions
/// - AssignRoleRequest.cs - Request model for assigning roles to users
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.
/// </summary>

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
