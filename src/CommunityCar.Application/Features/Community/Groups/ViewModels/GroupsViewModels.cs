/*
 * GROUPS VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * ================================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 8 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Core ViewModels:
 * - GroupVM.cs
 * - GroupSummaryVM.cs
 * - GroupsStatsVM.cs
 * - GroupsIndexVM.cs
 * - GroupsSearchVM.cs
 * 
 * CRUD ViewModels:
 * - CreateGroupVM.cs
 * - UpdateGroupVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Community.Groups.ViewModels;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
