/*
 * NEWS VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * ==============================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 2 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Core ViewModels:
 * - NewsVM.cs
 * - NewsSearchVM.cs
 * 
 * Additional ViewModels (already in separate files):
 * - NewsStatsVM.cs
 * - NewsItemVM.cs
 * - NewsEditVM.cs
 * - NewsCreateVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Community.News.ViewModels;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
