/*
 * FRIENDS VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * =================================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 6 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Core ViewModels:
 * - FriendsOverviewVM.cs
 * - FriendVM.cs
 * - FriendRequestVM.cs
 * - FriendSuggestionVM.cs
 * - FriendshipResultVM.cs
 * - FriendshipStatusVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Community.Friends.ViewModels;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
