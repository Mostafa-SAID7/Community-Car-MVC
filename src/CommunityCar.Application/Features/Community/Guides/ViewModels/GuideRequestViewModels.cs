/// Guide Request ViewModels
/// 
/// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. Each ViewModel class
/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
/// 
/// Individual files:
/// - GuideResultVM.cs - Guide operation result with success status and message
/// - CreateGuideRequest.cs - Request to create a new guide with localization support
/// - UpdateGuideRequest.cs - Request to update an existing guide
/// - GuideFilterVM.cs - Filter options for guide search and listing
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.
/// </summary>

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
