/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

/// - AnalyticsActivityVM.cs - User activity tracking with duration and metadata
/// - UserActivityStatsVM.cs - Comprehensive activity statistics and breakdowns
/// - AnalyticsInterestVM.cs - User interest tracking with scoring

/// - TrendingTopicVM.cs - Trending topic analytics with growth metrics
/// - PopularContentVM.cs - Popular content analytics with popularity scoring
