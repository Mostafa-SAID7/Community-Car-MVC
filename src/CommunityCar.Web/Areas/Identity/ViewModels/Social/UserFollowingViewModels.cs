/// is now in its own separate file within this namespace. This improves code organization,
/// reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

/// Individual files:
/// - NetworkUserVM.cs - Network user with following relationship details
/// - FollowingListVM.cs - List view for followers/following with pagination
/// - FollowingVM.cs - Individual following user details
/// - FollowStatsVM.cs - Following statistics and relationship status
/// - UserFollowListVM.cs - User follow list with pagination
/// - SuggestedUserVM.cs - Suggested user with mutual connections
/// - FollowSuggestionsVM.cs - Container for follow suggestions
/// - UserFollowingWebVM.cs - Web-specific alias for NetworkUserVM
/// - FollowingListWebVM.cs - Web-specific alias for FollowingListVM
/// - FollowingAnalyticsVM.cs - Analytics view for following relationships
/// - FollowUserRequest.cs - Request model for following a user
/// 
/// All classes maintain their original functionality and public API.

// The individual classes are now in separate files within this namespace.
// This file is kept for documentation and backward compatibility.
