/*
 * USER ACTIVITY VIEWMODELS REFERENCE FILE
 * =======================================
 * 
 * This file originally contained 7 ViewModels that have been split into separate files for better organization.
 * All ViewModels are now located in individual files within this same directory.
 * 
 * SPLIT FILES:
 * ============
 * 
 * Request ViewModels:
 * - CreateActivityRequest.cs
 * - RecordProfileViewRequest.cs
 * 
 * Activity ViewModels:
 * - TimelineActivityVM.cs
 * 
 * Profile View ViewModels:
 * - ProfileViewVM.cs
 * - ProfileViewStatsVM.cs
 * - ProfileViewAnalyticsVM.cs
 * - WhoViewedMyProfileVM.cs
 * - ProfileViewerVM.cs
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * Import individual ViewModels as needed:
 * using CommunityCar.Application.Features.Account.ViewModels.Activity;
 * 
 * All ViewModels maintain the same namespace and functionality as before.
 * This split improves code organization, maintainability, and reduces file size.
